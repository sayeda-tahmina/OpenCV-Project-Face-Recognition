# Automated Attendance System

# Introduction 
This is a project about Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System for Educational Institutions.
The process uses a computer application that captures a digital image of an individual's face and
compares it to images in a database of stored records. It detects the faces and marks attendance
accordingly. This system will prevent unnecessary wastage of time of classes that is usually
wasted in the form of class roll calls. This system will be designed using Python.

# Objective 
The goals we want to achieve by the this project :
1. Reducing time wastage during conventional class attendance
2. Utilizing the latest trends in machine vision to implement a feasible solution for the class
attendance system
3. Automating the whole process so that we have a digital environment
4. Preventing fake roll calls as one to one attendance marking is possible only
5. Encouraging the use of technology in daily lives
